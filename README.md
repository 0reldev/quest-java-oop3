# Quest "Java 08: Interface"

## Educational exercise from Wild Code School

The purpose of this exercise is to understand the concept of Java interfaces (what is it and when to use it), and learn how to create and implement multiple
interfaces.

An example is given with a <code>Penguin</code> class (extending a <code>Bird</code> class), which implements a <code>Swim</code> interface.
The <code>Penguin</code> class overrrides the methods from the <code>Swim</code> interface. 

The target is to get inspired from this example and create a <code>Eagle</code> class (extending a <code>Bird</code> abstract class), 
which implements a <code>Fly</code> interface.

In the <code>main</code> method from the <code>Nature</code> class, all the methods from the implemented interface are called on an instance of <code>Eagle</code>
to check that everything works.
